            <p class="par">Hi there! My name is Viktor Daniyelyan, and I am super exited to build my first portfolio and tell you about myself! <br>
            I'm 24 yo, from Portsmouth,NH. Absolutely love travel, landscape photography, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and have many many more favorite activities! <br>
            I was born in beautiful country Armenia in 1993, and have been traveling a lot. <br> After I greduated a high-school, I went for a Management degree in local University, and been there for 3.5 years.<br> <br> <br> Then I moved to US and never got my diploma.But I'm not really sad about it because it was boring and basic!<br>
            About 4 month ago, I found to be really interested in coding and programming and decicded to enroll in 6 month BootCamp programm, and I did. <br> By now I have completed my first week in bootcamp, and feeling amazing and at the same time lost! But we'll keep it going! Cheers!</p>
